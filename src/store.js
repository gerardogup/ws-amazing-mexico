It's an older Resort but it is very clean, and the staff has always been amazing. When we arrived Martin greeted us with 'welcome back home'. Then they sanitized our luggage, & had us walk through a mat sanitizer, & get our temperature taken by the hand sanitizer dispenser. We would have to repeat this process whenever we went to the buffet or restaurant .  The buffet was covered with plexiglass & the servers all wore gloves and masks. We just pointed at whatever we wanted & they would get it for us. They also had plexiglass around The Omelette station, and the other stations. They had the floor marked for self distancing.",
