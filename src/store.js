                "We were at Las Palmas by the sea,12/9/2020 through 12/15/2020 . We have stayed here many times before. It's an older Resort but it is very clean, and the staff has always been amazing. When we arrived Martin greeted us with 'welcome back home'. Then they sanitized our luggage, & had us walk through a mat sanitizer, & get our temperature taken by the hand sanitizer dispenser. We would have to repeat this process whenever we went to the buffet or restaurant .  The buffet was covered with plexiglass & the servers all wore gloves and masks. We just pointed at whatever we wanted & they would get it for us. They also had plexiglass around The Omelette station, and the other stations. They had the floor marked for self distancing.",

I paid a bit extra for the honeymoon suite which includes a king size bed with a balcony and jaccuzi that faces the ocean and pool area. Well worth it!! Jorge Rebolledo aka "Curly", aka "Oui, Oui" the entertainment manager is great. He keeps the activities going to keep you entertained if you are so obliged to join in (volleyball, aqua aerobics and pool games, karaoke etc). All of the wait staff was the best, but in particular Jorge (the waiter) was awesome. He made sure we were taken care every step of the way. Polite, courteous, funny, friendly, attentive and always had a smile. Be sure to visit Pipi\'s restaurant if you get a chance. Its not included at the hotel, but its a fun place, great food.',

                "I was very pleasantly surprised with the hotel. We booked on the recommendation of a friend, whose parents stay there when they go to Puerto Vallarta. This was our first trip to PV. We have stayed and many all inclusive hotels in other places. The food here was the best \"vacation food\" I have ever had. The hotel only has two restaurants a buffet and an order of the menu restaurant by the beach. The buffet was absolutely great, there was maybe one item that I didn't care for in the whole week. The omelet for breakfast were great. The Pasta was very good. All made to order as you waited. The beach restaurant food was good. I cant really give a good review for most of the food because on day one I tried a Smoked Marlin Burrito it it was so good I had that for lunch every day. I was absolutely delicious. The staff was very polite and very helpful. I needed my balcony cleaned because of some feathered friends that visited. It was cleaned before I came back to the room. German, Jorge and Juan made the meals and drinks entertaining. Location was perfect, A few blocks to the south was the Malecon. Fifty peso or three dollar cab ride to downtown/oldtown. About the same to go to the Marina. We actually took the blue bus which was peso's...",

                "Stayed at this resort in February 2021. Not many people there but we had a nice stay. Food was okay but because there were not many staying there the restaurants and selection was limited. Cleanliness was top notch and we really enjoyed the location of resort too. Steps outside the resort was a local bar/restaurant area and there was a trail to walk out to a point also. The beach was nice and always local action to watch from our balcony. We had a corner master suite and it was great. Wrap around balcony, 2 bathrooms, 2 mini bars and huge master bath area. The pool area was gorgeous and water was warm. The resort could use some updating but for this level of stay it was nice and we would return.",

                  "What a lovely place to stay! If you are looking for peace and relaxation in a bustling world, this is where you need to be. We had done a time share exchange and had the meal plan and ate every single meal at the resort. Waiters and staff were gracious and helpful. Jesus, our waiter for lunch and dinner, went out of his way to help with local information and any special food requests. Abraham, who took care of us at dinner was the same, although his English was not quite as good as Jesus......no matter......and we have -0- Spanish. Christian at the sushi bar was also great for evening cocktails. Our room was ocean front and we could hear the sound of the surf all night. Our two day trips into Cabo San Lucas convinced us that we had stayed in the right place. Nice to visit but wouldn't want to stay in town! Be sure to visit San Jose del Cabo and walk the Estuary Trail. Next time we will rent a car and travel up the coast to all the small fishing villages.............can't wait to go back!",

Christian the activities coordinator was AWESOME we have not been able to stop talking about him, this young man is a jack of all trades! Tania the bar tender at the swim-bar was easy going, funny and kept the drinks flowing.

                  "What a lovely place to stay! If you are looking for peace and relaxation in a bustling world, this is where you need to be. We had done a time share exchange and had the meal plan and ate every single meal at the resort. Waiters and staff were gracious and helpful. Jesus, our waiter for lunch and dinner, went out of his way to help with local information and any special food requests. Abraham, who took care of us at dinner was the same, although his English was not quite as good as Jesus......no matter......and we have -0- Spanish. Christian at the sushi bar was also great for evening cocktails. Our room was ocean front and we could hear the sound of the surf all night. Our two day trips into Cabo San Lucas convinced us that we had stayed in the right place. Nice to visit but wouldn't want to stay in town! Be sure to visit San Jose del Cabo and walk the Estuary Trail. Next time we will rent a car and travel up the coast to all the small fishing villages.............can't wait to go back!",

Christian the activities coordinator was AWESOME we have not been able to stop talking about him, this young man is a jack of all trades! Tania the bar tender at the swim-bar was easy going, funny and kept the drinks flowing. Jesus the lead server was great and helpful, explained everything we had questions on and also got the food out quickly. I was extremely amazed, this resort was everything I was looking for this trip. I can't wait to go back, I've been recommending it to everyone I know.",

We were unable to get into a couple of the areas because the vet and animal phsycologist were working with the animals. The animals were spread out over the resort so it was a really great experience to see the difference this reserve made to the rescues. Definitely worth seeing if you love animals.",
